swaps the elements of arrays, the other function takes pointer of 2d array, number of rows and columns, and prints the array in a flattened
shape. In this particular situation, there are 2 arrays(a1 and a2). This program first print the 2d array which consists of a1 and a2, then
swapped the elements of a1 and a2, and prints the swapped version of 2d array.
